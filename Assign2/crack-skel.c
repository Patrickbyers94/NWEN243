/* Program developed for NWEN243, Victoria University of Wellington
   Author: Kris Bubendorfer, this extended version (c) 2015
   LAB: 2

   This program applies a basic frequency analysis on a cyphertext.  It has been extened over the 2014 version to
   solve polyalphabetic cyphers - by brute force.  In this case, it applies the frequency analysis for different 
   numbers of n keys (polyalphabetic Caeser).  Obviously it will need a cypher of about n times
   the typical length for a monoalphabetic cypher.

   Program is used like this:

   Compile:  gcc -o crack crack.c

   Test file (ctext): JWRLS, XSSH PZK JH HES BJFV, UZU (this is not a realistic length piece of cypher text)

   crack n

   Argument:

   n number of keys to try

   ---

   % cat ctext | crack 1
   ALICE, MEET YOU AT THE PARK, BOB   <-- of course it won't be this correct.  Don't worry about that for the -d option.
   AMFDE, UEET LNH AT TIE RASC, ONO   <-- this is what it really looks like, a larger sample is better, this is short.

  /* At this point we have two things,
   *   1. The input cyphertext in "text"
   *   2. The maximum number of keys to try (n) - we'll be trying 1..n keys.
   *
   * What you need to do is as follows:
   *   1. create a for-loop that will check key lengths from 1..n
   *   2. for each i <= n, spit the cypher text into i sub-texts.  For i = 1, 1 subtext, for i = 2, 2 subtexts, of alternating characters etc.
   *   3. for each subtext: 
   *          a. count the occurance of each letter 
   *          b. then map this onto the CHFREQ, to create a map between the sub-text and english
   *          c. apply the new map to the subtext 
   *   4. merge the subtexts
   *   5. output the 'possibly' partially decoded text to stdout.  This will only look OK if i was the correct number of keys
   *
   * what you need to output (sample will be provided) - exactly:
   * i maps -> stderr
   * i 'possible' translations
   *
   * You would be wise to make seperate functions that perform various sub-tasks, and test them incrementally.  Any other approach will likely
   * make your brain revolt.  This isn't a long program, mine is 160 lines, with comments (and written in a very verbose style) - if yours is
   * getting too long, double check you're on the right track.
